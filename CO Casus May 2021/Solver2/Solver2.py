    Purpose:
        Try to find a solution with minimum cost by using the simulated annealing algorithm
    Input:
        scheduleCombined, the initial schedule (made with makeDeliveryScheduleClusters(), but then all the clusters combined in one list) (so not created by combineRoutes())
        requests, matrix with the requests of the problem
        machines, matrix with the machines of the problem
        costs, dictionary with the costs of the problem
        Graph, the graph of the problem
        constraints, dictionary with the constraints of the problem
        numberRequests, integer with the number of requests
        numberMachines, integer with the number of machines
        numberTechnicians, integer with the number of technicians
        technicians, matrix with the technicians of the problem
        clusterTech, list of lists with the home location of each technician per cluster
        numberLocations, integer with the number of locations
    Output:
        bestS, the best solution the simulation could find within the time constraint and cool down constraint (time < maxTime and T > 0.01:)
